# Hi, I'm David 👋🏽😁
Hi, I'm DaveTheWay1 because DaveTheWay was taken.
haha.. anywho, I thought of dave the way because my friends call me dave; my name is David. 
Next thing that came to mind was Pave the way and, so, here we are. 
I'm "Daving" the way with my coding creations using this github account where I hope to fail and succeed, but most importantly, learn!
So, there will be erros, "good" code, "bad" code, success, and ACTIVE projects forver.
An overall very oganized mess! Join me on my journey as my destination will shock the world and more!!!!
